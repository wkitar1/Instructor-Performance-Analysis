# Instructor Performance Analysis Using Statistical Linear Models

This project investigates the performance of five university instructors (Love, Joy, Peace, Goodness, and Kindness) based on student exam data. The objective is to identify the best three instructors for retention, based on the students' performance across five exams.

Project Details

- **Data**: Performance scores of five students per instructor, assessed over five exams.
- **Pre-Test Observation**: A pre-test was given to all students before the exercise, and no significant differences in their initial performances were observed.
- **Methodology**: Statistical Linear Models, including ANOVA, post hoc tests, and mixed repeated measures ANOVA.
- **Tool**: IBM SPSS Statistics
- **Significance Levels**: 0.01 and 0.1 as applicable.
- **Objective**: Recommend the best three instructors for retention.

## Approaches Used

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Separate Investigation (Exam by Exam)
- Tested normality and instructor effects across each exam.
- Identified top-performing instructors based on separate exams.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Investigation Using Exam Totals
- Analyzed total exam scores using ANOVA and post hoc tests.
- Determined instructors' overall performance.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Mixed Repeated Measures ANOVA
- Assessed overall instructor performance and consistency across exams.
- Checked assumptions (e.g., sphericity, normality of residuals).

## Final Results

Based on the analysis across all three approaches, the top three instructors are:
- **Kindness**
- **Goodness**
- **Peace**
